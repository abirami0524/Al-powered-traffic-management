## 📘 Project Overview

The **AI-Powered Smart Traffic Management System** is an intelligent platform built to analyze **real-time traffic conditions** from multiple camera feeds and sensor data to optimize traffic flow in **Indian metropolitan cities**.  

It automatically detects congestion, predicts future traffic patterns, and dynamically adjusts signal timings to reduce waiting time, enhance road safety, and support pollution control initiatives.

> ⚙️ Designed for **Indian traffic complexity** (cars, buses, auto-rickshaws, bikes, cycles).  
> ⚡ Real-time performance: **< 5 seconds per frame** using local computation (no cloud APIs).  
> 🧩 Modular Python backend for integration with **existing CCTV and traffic signal systems**.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Predict and prevent **traffic congestion** through real-time analytics.  
- Implement **dynamic signal control** based on live data.  
- Enable **emergency vehicle priority routing**.  
- Provide **pedestrian safety monitoring** and **accident alerts**.  
- Correlate **pollution levels** with traffic density.  
- Deliver **insightful reports** for urban planners using AI-based summarization.

## 🚀 Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Vehicle Detection & Counting** | Detects and classifies vehicles (cars, buses, autos, bikes, etc.) using OpenCV + CNN models. |
| **Traffic Density Estimation** | Calculates congestion levels in real time from CCTV feeds. |
| **Dynamic Signal Timing** | Adjusts traffic light durations dynamically using predictive analytics. |
| **Accident Detection & Alerts** | Identifies collision or stoppage patterns and triggers alerts to traffic control centers. |
| **Emergency Vehicle Priority** | Detects ambulances/fire trucks and creates a green corridor. |
| **Pedestrian Safety Monitoring** | Ensures signal control prioritizes pedestrian crossings when necessary. |
| **Pollution & Traffic Correlation** | Integrates air quality sensor data to study emission vs. traffic patterns. |
| **Automated Reports** | Generates daily traffic summaries using Hugging Face open-source LLMs. |
